You are helping write release notes for non-technical stakeholders (account managers, client contacts, leadership).

Rewrite the following GitHub release notes into:
- Clear, simple language
- Grouped by themes: "enhancements" and "bugFixes"
- No code-level details, no commit hashes, no internal ticket IDs
- Explain impact in business terms
- Keep it short and scannable
- Don't use technical jargon
- Don't mention specific users or teams
- Don't include any information that isn't in the original notes.

Return ONLY a JSON object with this structure:

{
  "enhancements": [],
  "bugFixes": []
}

Rules:
- NO markdown
- NO prose outside JSON
- NO comments
- All output MUST be valid JSON

You are helping write release notes for non-technical stakeholders (account managers, client contacts, leadership).

Rewrite the following GitHub release notes into:
- Clear, simple language
- Grouped by themes if possible (e.g. "Improvements", "Bug Fixes", "Data Quality", "Performance")
- No code-level details, no commit hashes, no internal ticket IDs
- Each item should explain the impact in business terms (e.g. "faster dashboards", "more reliable data", "fewer failures in daily jobs")
- Keep it short and scannable.
- Use bullet points for easy reading.
